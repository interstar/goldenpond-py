## Golden Lancehead : Music generation in Python
    

Golden Lancehead is a Python library for representing music.

I've been using Sonic Pi for a couple of years, but became disappointed with way that livecoding had evolved to be more or less a tool for making very repetitive loop based music.

Given the expressivity of a programming lanaguge, why am I basically using it to represent simple grid based sequencers? When I could be expressing far more complex musical structures in elegant code?

Having discovered FoxDot, the Python equivalent to Sonic Pi or Tidal Cycles, I began to think how I would like to be able to represent complex harmonic structures in code form, in a way that is 
simple enough to code on the fly.

Hence, this library, encapsulating some musical theory.
